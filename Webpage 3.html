<h1>
He has a Cool Pencil
</h1>
<p>
DoodleBob has a cool pencil that he can just 
draw and whatever he draws becomes real and 
he can also just erase anything and no other 
character has that ability or has any other 
ability they are just boring because they 
can't do anything cool like DoodleBob can.
