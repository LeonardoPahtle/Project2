Why DoodleBob is the best Character in SpongeBob
</h1>
<p>
SpongeBob is a T.V. Show and DoodleBob is one 
of the characters in the show and he is the 
best one because he is funny, he looks cool, 
and he has a cool pencil that has a really cool 
ability even though many other characters are also 
funny and look cool DoodleBob is still the best.
