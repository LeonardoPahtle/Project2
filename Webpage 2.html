<h1>
He looks Cool
</h1>
<p>
DoodleBob just looks cool he looks better 
than all the other characters in the show 
because he is just the better version of 
SpongeBob he is just a doodle of SpongeBob 
and he looks funny and the drawing is just 
simple so that is what makes him cool because 
it is a simple drawing.
