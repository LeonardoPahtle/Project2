<h1>
He is Funny
</h1>
<p>
DoodleBob is funny because he has been 
in the show and he just sounds funny and 
does funny things with his cool pencil 
that he has and any episode he is in will 
make you laugh because he is just funny and 
some other characters are funny too but 
DoodleBob is just better because all the 
other characters wish they can be DoodleBob.
</p>
<h2>
Also many people don't understand DoodleBob 
and even though no one understands him and 
no one knows what he wants to say he is still 
funny because we can kind of understand him.
